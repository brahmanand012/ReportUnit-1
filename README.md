# ReportUnit
This is a repo showing examples of MSTests which are run via a TestRunner.bat file.

Contained within the TestRunner.bat file is two lines which do the following:

1) Execute all the MSTest Methods in the UnitTests.dll and produces a TestResults.trx file
2) Execute ReportUnit Version 1.5 Beta and Produce TestResults.html in a nice format to read and report our test results
